This is an Android mobile application which leverages a few NASA APIs.
1) NASA's Astronomy Photo of the Day (APOD): the photo of the day is displayed to the user on the homepage.
2) Insight (Mars Weather Service): another activity of the application displays the weather at Elysium Planitia...a plain on Mars. 
3) NASA Photo and Image Library: another activity of the application allows the user to search NASA's photo and image library and view the media they select.

The last activity of the application is a little scavenger-hunt-like and provides information about the what the application displays as well as prompts the user to explore the API's.
